# When should I walk?

### 1.Introduction:

The idea of this feature is to give the user a bit more room to choose the specifics of their walk.
The  default  mode  of  the  app  is  ”sunny  mode”:  it  will  look  for  the  most comfortable and sunniest hour.
This feature adds a rainy mode and a night mode, as well as some visual changes. 

### 2. Essential Features:

- Different algorithms for each mode.
- An easy way to change between those.

### 3. Nice to have features:

- Change the background with each mode.
- Add a ”history” card, with some minimal info of the last search, always displayed.

# 4. Technologies:
 - React
 - React bootstrap
 - API for the weather forecast -> https://www.weatherapi.com/ 



### 1. Database design

One database needed to store walks:
